# AIChat - AI-Powered Chat and Avatar Interaction App  

## 🏛 Architecture  
AIChat adopts a **VIPER architecture** with **SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, and the Observation framework**, ensuring a **scalable, maintainable, and testable** codebase.  

It leverages **dependency injection, protocol-oriented programming, and modularized Swift Packages** to enhance **decoupling, reusability, and separation of concerns**.
